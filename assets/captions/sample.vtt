Hello! So you want to learn how to make websites.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In that case you need to learn HTML!

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So let's start at the very beginning.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
What exactly is HTML?

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And why do I need it?

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Let's break it down from the basics, and build our way up.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It uses markup to describe the structure of web pages.

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The structure is built up by elements, and they are represented by tags!

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Tags label pieces of content such as "heading"

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
"paragraph" "table" and so on.

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
These tags aren't shown on the page,

13
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but are used to display content in different ways.

14
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
That's a lot to digest!

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So let's go into it.

NOTE
Simple HTML Example Walkthrough

16
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
First let's try it together.

17
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Don't worry about understanding, it'll all click as we work through it.

18
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We start by declaring that this is an HTML document.

19
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The &lt;html&gt; is the root element of any HTML page.

20
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The &lt;head&gt; contains meta information about the document.

21
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The &lt;title&gt; element specifies a title for the document.

22
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The &lt;body&gt; contains the visible page content.

23
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Finally, the &lt;h1&gt; defines a large heading, while &lt;p&gt; defines a paragraph.

24
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
With everything set in the order, let's

25
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
go into the explanation of how tags work.

NOTE
HTML Tags

26
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Tags typically come in pairs.

27
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
A start tag, and the end tag.

28
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The end tag is written just like the start tag,

29
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name.

30
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Here we've got the tag name and the forward slash tag name.

31
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And the contents of the element in between them.

32
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So if this was a paragraph, we'd use &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; and some text in the middle.

33
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Let's play a game.

34
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:23.000
See if we can correctly match start, and end tags, together.

NOTE
How Web Browsers Work

35
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So what turns HTML code and elements into a viewable website?

36
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Well, that's where web browsers come in.

37
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The purpose of a web browser, be it Chrome, Firefox, Edge,

38
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
or Safari, is to read HTML documents and display them.

39
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
But, the browser does not display the HTML code.

40
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Instead, it uses it, to determine how to display the document.

41
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Let's see what kind of building blocks are hidden behind this webpage.

42
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
This is a visualization of an HTML page structure.

43
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
You can see the HTML, the head, with the page title

44
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
below that, and then the body under that.

45
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And that's the basics.

46
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Let's delve into this further, but for now, take a break.
